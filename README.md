A time/earning tracking program

Problem
Nana recently started a consulting business where he is paid based on the number of hours and minutes he works on client projects.
He needs a time tracking program, where he enters the date and the time he started working on a task, and then the date and time when he finished a particular task. 
The program calculates the hours he spent on a task. It then calculates the amount of money Nana made tackling the task.

Our solution
This project is developed to help Nana track the number of hours he works on a project and how much he earns for each task.

Tool/ software
The programme was developed using python 3.8 and its resources 

Algorithm
The team used the  following steps to arrive at the solution for Nana
1. Determine how much Nana is paid per hour per task
2. Built an input function that requests for a task ID, task name and the name of client. This to help Nana easily reference tasks
3. An input function tha requests for start time of a task
4. At completion, the system generates the current time and store in a variable and automatically calculates the number of hours and minutes Nana spends on a task
5. The amount per hour is then multiplied by the duration spent on the task to generate the total earning for the task.
6. The system then generates a report that show the projects and its corresponding earnings in a CSV format
